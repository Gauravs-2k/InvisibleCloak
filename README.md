# InvisibleCloak
This just a small model which I tried to build. 
I was interested in doing this after watching Harry Potter.

# Packages Required
OpenCV.

# How it works.
This is basically acts the reverse way as the green screen model.
In this model it captures the background image and then when it detects the red color, then it tries to merge it behind and make the background visible.

# How to use
1. Download the file
2. Run the python script. dont come infront of the camera for 5seconds. 
3. Later you can come infront of the camera and use a red cloth to hide yourself behind it.
